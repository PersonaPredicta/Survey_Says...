I'd love a space where I can take my own challenges on my team and in terms of my experience and work on those so I have a game plan when I get back to my office--i.e. maybe some coaching in how to define challenges and possible approaches, with some solid materials on tech trends in digital products. \n",

      "I'd also consider bringing in some random topics. Opera. Bookbinding. NASA water systems. I read an article years back about a leading designer who was being asked about how he kept engaged with his craft. He said he studies \"other\" things. He'd take ballroom dancing, or read about physics, or any non-subject related topics. Inevitably he'd find inspiration in those topics while reflecting on design tasks.  We're creatures of analogy. Setting up learning experiences where we can let individuals connect the dots between seemingly unrelated topics can be exhilarating!  \n",

      "Please have a conference about research!!! Design is so much more widely accepted and gaining traction, and research teams are coming up right behind them (in my universe, not everywhere). Would love to learn about best practices, methods, how to make an impact. I would love the opportunity to build more solid relationships with the interesting people I have encountered in places like Twitter and Slack. Have it in NYC, that is your stomping ground! Try it as a 1 day event and see how it goes. If it's awesome, make it longer + workshops. I'd love a day in NYC to hear a bunch of talks. I would also love to see how I could be paired or teamed up with people who have a similar level of experience/challenges so we could cohort together and share how we work and help each other advance. Looking forward to hearing more about your findings and how this might manifest into an event!\n",

      "Front Utah did a great job with the welcoming committee and allowing for longer breaks between sessions (4 30-minute talks, and then a 30 minute break). They also did a great job of getting folks out into the surrounding city where they host (every swag bag had a $20 bill and a map of local restaurants w/in walking distance -- attendees were encouraged to group up and go find lunch).\n",
      "Lots of conferences use Slack for pre-conference introductions, a channel for each speaker, they handle Q&A through the Slack channels (which allows attendees to \"vote\" for their questions if they've already been asked)... it's an interesting use of a communication platform like that.\n",

      "Think outside the typical conference box. Allow for more discussion and deep dives on actual research studies. As a participant I want to engage and create take-aways and artifacts that I can share with colleagues when I get back to work. I don't mind getting homework to complete. I want to network through structured activities. I want to stay connected to fellow participants over time and continue discussions until the next \"conference\". \n",

For example, I would love to hear how someone leads a global research team, but that advice isn't immediately relevant to me since I'm far from being a supervisor.  Instead, I'd be interested to hear from someone who has been in research for 1-2 years, and built a research practice from the ground up.

Both of these conferences (UX Burlington and Talk UX) were nicely intimate, and you could eat lunch with the speakers if you were lucky to sit at the same table as them. Lot's of food options for folks with food sensitivities and allergies is always appreciated! Most conferences default to the sandwich/wrap/salad option, but I always say conferences should consider a burrito bar. \n",

      "I don't know what the ideal ratio is for most people  of talks to not-talks. My growing preference is \"anything but talks\". Sitting quietly to see people talk for 8 hours seems like an inefficient way to learn or spend your time, and doesn't suit my learning style.\n",
