No seriously, think about who your target group is, and how to advertise. If it was too generic, I would not feel it's urgent/interesting enough to give up another conference for it (because that's probably what it would boil down to).

Maybe co-locate with existing large conferences? In my area that would be CHI (Computer-Human Interaction), you could add a day on. That would increase my chances of going, because I would not get funding to travel to a conference if I can't present a paper there, and if it isn't high impact.

We had to read many scientific publications for the different subjects.I'm on the steering committee of the conference series that is closest to my research area, I try to attend that one every year, there's a couple of conferences I'm interested in, but usually can't attend, because I often go to the ones I get invited to speak at (as keynote).
Living in Australia, conferences are very far away and ideally you combine it with other travel to keep costs down and to have to go through jetlag only twice. That means that each travel is about 2 or 3 weeks, and you need someone who can cover your teaching, unless it's over the Australian summer (Dec-Feb), which not many events are.SARMAC conference in 2003 (I think), it was a conference outside my direct field, and I learned so much, because every talk started with an introduction to a fascination new topic (to me). I attended everything I could :) Later I took my PhD students to the same conference, hoping they would have the same experience.None, never.Small conference: < 300 attendeesSingle-track: All attendees experience the same content at the same timeStudios: hands-on activities organised and facilitated by an expert, e.g. in teaching you how to use a certain data analysis tool or recording devices or survery builders (anything really)How to sell qualitative research to a quantitative audience ;-)
The latest on participant populations, e.g. we no longer ask for gender, age seems less relevant as well, how to describe your participant group, are there new standards emerging?
How to make sure academic research gets outside of academia?Researchers from all walks of life, not just academics.
And research clients in the real world, not just funding bodies and promotion committees.Good luck :)

No seriously, think about who your target group is, and how to advertise. If it was too generic, I would not feel it's urgent/interesting enough to give up another conference for it (because that's probably what it would boil down to).

Maybe co-locate with existing large conferences? In my area that would be CHI (Computer-Human Interaction), you could add a day on. That would increase my chances of going, because I would not get funding to travel to a conference if I can't present a paper there, and if it isn't high impact.

You could consider going digital? But I've never attended such an event, don't know whether it would be as compelling.",2,0.13679755630842588,0.43929183135704875

I love the EURO IA event, because of the vibe and great people coming there and  interesting topics off course; same for the Interaction event and Confab content strategy event. Because of price and distance, I’m unfortunately not able to attend these as often as I would like. 
I am also really fond of UXcamp Amsterdam, because of the involvement of everyone and the opportunity to share knowledge myself. 
Other conferences like User Insights in the Netherlands are also very nice.
And last but not least and my main go to events, are meetups, mostly free or for a small price. Several groups are so open and pro diversity, it’s also fairly easy to contributie to these kinds of meetups as speaker ir giving a workshop. The topics are off course quite diverse, but I like that.  These meetups are:
Amsterdam UX
Ladies that UX Amsterdam 
Ladies that UX Utrecht (I’m co organiser since sept 2018)
Creative Mornings
Behavioural design Amsterdam
User research
Social UX
Social Innovation

For example, couldn't attend the EPIC conference in Hawaii because it was expensive to go and logistically complicated to get there for me. n/an/aSmall conference: < 300 attendeesSingle-track: All attendees experience the same content at the same timeLess powerpoint sessions, more interactive sessions. Incorporating anthropology into business research (but hearing from anthropologists/academics instead of industry insiders who think they understand anthropology).More non-profits who we might learn about doing field research from i.e. UN Agencies especially. I think what we lack is real insight into some of the challenges of doing fieldwork for business.  Less industry folks who only see number and dollar signs, more experienced social scientists. Use the time wisely. Don't start on an odd day of the week. Don't make the conference too long or complicated to understand/organize (for example the AAA conference is WAY to big). Don't forget about students who might want to attend but not have the financial means to go -- scholarships?

It was a last minute ticket purchase, but I loved seeing Dr. Sam Ladner speak. They also offered wonderful afternoon 45 minute seminars that were really refreshing and scrappy. I think the ticket was $90, it was possibly the best value i've got from a conference ticket price ever. There weren't a tonne of frills, but honestly I was there for the content and it was a perfect one day injection of local research in action.  

The CreativeMornings Summit in 2018 held on some camp grounds in upper state new york were the pinnacle of experience design, Seth Godin spoke and conducted a riveting ""real talk"" Q&A that was really illuminating. 

SOTA – The Society of Typography Aficionados (hilarious title) offered the most wonderful full-day workshops with master typographers and it was ~8-10 students...it was so intimate and robust in content. It was maybe another $100 on top of the conference price, but it was worth it for the quality of the interaction.

I have raved about the two GEL conferences I attended (https://creativegood.com/gel/). I loved that you got to do experiences together. They were tangentially related to design but I left feeling like I had made lots of connections, both in a cognitive as well as relationship sense.

I'm not a fan of filter bubbles but sometimes it can be exhausting at events to be inundated with questions from people who are new to something and want to pick your brain. 
* I like how at CHI you can also get grouped with people to lunch with and you virtually meet them in advance (less intimidating for introverts).
* It could be interesting to do ""working studio sessions."" Like you could bring a project that you've been meaning to work on but never get to, and then buddy up with a small group of people who are working on something similar. Then your goal would be by the end of the session to make some progress during that time and share/get feedback on it.
* Taking advantage of the location and somehow incorporating it into the conference. For example, if it were in Seattle, it would be interesting to tour the Space Needle and learn about how/what their research team has been up to. 
* I have always been interested in the retreat format, but price has always been a barrier. I can't afford $4000 + travel costs! Is there a way to do retreats that don't cost a bundle?

I used what I learned from that experience to design an incredible offsite for my organization a few months after I returned.
- A 2-day immersive workshop-class on analyzing data that I took from IIT many years ago.  It was full of tools (some of which were new to me) and hands-on feedback.  Not only did I walk away with tools and skills that I didn't have before, I used THAT experience to design immersive learning courses in the future (it was one of the earliest learn-by-doing classes that I'd taken).UXPA International 2018, data analytics online course, meetups...Size matters for learning topics, but not networking and inspiration.Unconference: Attendees bring the content and the schedule emerges from who wants to presentTo make a conference really be incredible, MAKING something that they take away is critical.

Now that I wrote that, I think it might be pretty cool to do a hands-on session on Sketchnoting at the beginning of the conference, so people who haven't ever done it before will learn how, and then people can practice using sketchnoting during the conference (which creates an artifact to remind them later).

In my recent roles there has no longer been an emphasis on this but rather on strategic research to identify opportunities.  It feels like market research and UX research are blending to some degree.  As someone with 15 years of experience I have started to see usability of products decrease as organizations more and more emphasize strategic research (evaluative methods seem to be just taken for granted or ignored completely).  I'd love to learn if some organizations are keeping a good balance and not ignoring one critical aspect of what we do.  I'd also love to talk about this more with others in terms of the future of UX Research in organizations.I'd love to see some of the originals.

I'm at a point where traveling far for 101 level talks is just not useful to me. The Strive conference in 2018 was well done. I appreciated the focus on research and found the experience level of both speakers and attendees made it worthwhile. I did not attend this year's conference, but had several people mention to me that they found it a great place to commiserate, but they did not come away from the conference with a lot of clear solutions or takeaways. I have discussed this a bit with Steve, but I find the challenge with anything research-based is that there just aren't very many clear best practices or one-size-fits-all solutions to things. One of the reasons I appreciate a conference with a lot of experienced people is that I can listen to variety of experiences and case studies and hear how others have tackled problems they face and synthesize various parts of those into my own unique solutions and problems. Every org and every research project is its own situation. No two are alike. Every org has different culture and politics and capabilities. It's up to us as researchers to devise the solution that fits best. So one thing I would keep in mind is that anyone coming to a research conference hoping to walk away with all the answers they need in some cut and dried state is likely to leave disappointed. This may sound really obvious, but it's something I've only personally realized rather recently. Strive conference (Toronto), EPIC conferenceMid-size conference : 300-500 attendeesMulti-track: Every attendee chooses their own path with multiple options available for most time-slotsI like the idea of AMAs and discussion tables, as they allow researchers to talk about the way they've approached and solved problems, and for more give/take in terms of learning from each other.

Made a couple friends in the group work portions of the day 1 workshop that I was able to talk to and go out to lunch with on day 2. For the keynotes, I didn't have to choose tracks of talks and/or miss out on talks because there was only one stage/track. They were all great talks, too, so that contributed to my overall satisfaction. Got to choose from 3 different workshops on day 3.

I'm not interested in listening to people who are spouting their own opinions without evidence that peopl other than themselves have had measurable success with the techniques they espouse.I can't think of the ""best"" because I have had many excellent experiences. However, an aspect the best have had in common were that the instructors were academics who were not getting paid for running the course and had no motivation other than we learn how to do the technique that had been rigorously tested: Herb Simon teaching think-aloud protocol elicitation, Clayton Lewis teaching Cognitive Walkthrough, Peter Polson and Dave Kieras teaching GOMS, Dennis Wixon teaching Contextual Inquiry (when he was at DEC, working with Karen Holtzblatt). All of these (except the first) were at CHI conference courses and all were quite a while ago. Sadly CHI has changed their course structure and fewer academics teach practical courses now (though some still do, see below). I find the consultants who teach are often trying to make their students into clients, so they don't teach in as much detail, or with as much honesty about when the technique is NOT appropriate, as I need to do the technique myself.IMO this CHI 2019 course was excellent: https://chi2019.acm.org/accepted-courses/#economic-models-hciAll of these are fine. I can learn in all if them if the courses are constructed to match the size and venue.Anything except the ""unconference"". When I am there to learn, it is most efficient for the organizes to structure it to deliver the learning experiences for optimal benefit. (And face it, most people are not great instructors.)I am there to learn efficiently, not socialize, so the thing you didn't mention is the availability of course notes (at least the speakers' slides) that I can study before and after the talks.
I have also been at conferences that have a knowledgeable discussant associated with each 1-hour talk. The discussant has studied the work before and asks pointed questions about pros and cons, relationship to other techniques, points of failure, etc. When the speaker knows this is coming, you are less likely to get just a canned talk and you really get to the meat of the issues.New research techniques, but only if they are presented in an evidence-based way, are usually based on psychological theory not opinion, and their pros and cons are presented in relationship to well-known research techniques.Jeff Sauro (yes, I know all I said above about consultants.

It was 4 days long and was an intensive workshop with outstanding teachers. It was held at Alan Cooper's ranch in Northern CA, so the setting was beautiful and inspiring and away from the noise and distraction of the city. There were only 30 or so participants to a staff of 4 teachers and Alan and Sue stopped by throughout to hang out and answer questions. Everything was focused to teaching Goal-Directed Design and I had little free time which was fine because I was there to learn. 

Some of the most important factors were:
Ample time - 4 days - to learn the material and practice
Quality teachers - not just outstanding in their field, but quality teachers
Environment - Everything was designed around learning

Sometimes I wonder if I fell in love with UX Design or the experience of learning it.EPIC 2018, UI20, IXDA 2017, Cooper U several times 2013-2016Retreat/workshop: < 50 attendeesSingle-track: All attendees experience the same content at the same timeI learn best from Workshop type conferences.

I'm very fortunate that my company is very supportive of encouraging employees to attend conferences and events, so travel is not too much of an obstacle as long as I can explain why an event would be of particular benefit to me.I think that I'd say EPIC, due to its diversity both in terms of content and the variety of formats throughout the conference. In addition to presentations, panel discussions and case studies, the schedule also included salons (small groups assembled to participate in guided discussions), pechakuchas, a short film session and an exhibition space. This gave plenty of opportunities to dive deep into certain topics while also 'take a break' and feel refreshed by lighter sessions, like the pechakuchas. The social events were also top-notch, which is certainly a plus. Research specific - EPIC, Strive UXR Conference; General UX - UX London, UX Week, UX New Zealand, FLUPA UX Days, UX AustraliaIt's hard to pick an ideal size! I'd say 500+ would start to get pretty impersonal, but it really depends what networking opportunities the organisers provide. I've never been to a retreat-style event, but intrigued by this!Leaning towards multi-track, but moreover I appreciate a variety of formats throughout an event. Some straight talks, some opportunities for deeper interaction and discussion. Never tried an unconference, so not sure how successfully this would work!As I've mentioned above, for me it's really about getting a balance of all of the above rather than any type of session being more important or valuable than another. Again a question of balance. :) Some content getting into the nitty-gritty of methods, some content that is future-focused/aspirational, some content that is thought-provoking/controversial, some content that looks outside the UX research bubble ie. analogous industriesIt's great to learn from people who have oodles of experience, are foundational to the industry, come from hot companies with big budgets doing amazing work, but you also don't want to hear from the same people over and over again.

I think SIGCHI does a pretty good job at this. 

I feel like there is a divide between user researchers working in industry and HCI and UCD people in academia. From the conversations I've been having with practitioners in both fields there is a tendency to 'look down' on each other. I find people who work in academic settings find people working in industry taking a bit of a 'fast and loose' approach to research. On the other hand, I find people working in industry see people working in academic backgrounds to work in an overly philosophical/ivory tower/slow way in terms of their research approch

I think there is a real opportunity to bridge the gap between the two.  There's a ton the two could learn from each other. Research topics that take us beyond the screen.

Travel time matters because it's exhausting and expensive. I liked Eyeo because it didn't require travel during the weekend. I liked IA Summit because it could be done in a long weekend. I don't generally get funding to go to international conferences, but even so, I'm more mindful of my carbon footprint and would be inclined to go to a conference someplace I also wanted to vacation. If the weather was good there then (N.O. in August is NO)A lot of the CHI conferences were great in the 90s. I was exposed to a lot of very different people and HCI interests, research, demos, videos, talks. Sadly a couple of recent ones I attended were not as good, likely because of the hostile border keeping out international attendees (USA). 

More recently, the Internet Freedom Festival, because it exposed me to people doing research and high-stakes training and community organizing with people at risk. It also allowed me to volunteer on open-source products and understand how security professionals think about privacy and security. Maybe about 1000 people, also, which is a good size. Easily the most international conference I've been to as well. Meetup on MLUX, a meetup on UXR that I started and taught for a year. Small conference: < 300 attendeesSingle-track: All attendees experience the same content at the same timeIt's not so much about the format for me as the content. I thought the IA Summit and XOXO and Eyeo had the best program ideas and mix in my own experience. Eyeo was dual track. Smallish, focused, lots of time to meet people, a wide variety of speakers and interesting talksField studies (what we learned and how our methods changed), international studies (how best to conduct studies when you don't speak the language). Social context methods for understanding the effects of products on groups. Usable privacy and security, ethics in UX research (Montiero), running a UX practice (Cooper), guerilla research (Chipchase), how to be a successful independent UXR consultant, which corners to cut (or not) when you have to do research fast and cheaply. Vigorous debate on the level of detail in deliverables. UK Digital Services

POCHave a lot of them rather than one, small, exclusive one. Go do it where the interested attendees are.
Offer day-long or multiday workshops for the people who need to learn methods.
Look into whether you could offer continuing education credits for people who need that.
Ask attendees during registration to chip in to the scholarship funds for people who can't pay to go. Get some sponsorship for that.
No plastic water bottles and as few as possible disposables
No junk swag, no RM-logo t-shirts
Recycle lanyards and badgeholders
No photos without permission
People can put what they want on their badges, but focus on first names
Get someone to make a more usable Attendify and use that
Start a Mattermost for attendees to talk and network in across all your conferences
Publish videos of all the talks for free so you can help people not have to travel and so you can multiply the educational effectiveness over time and distance
Breakfast worth waking up for
Easy ways to hang out with each other in the evenings, such as dinner party lotteries, BOFs, geeky fun
Sessions that start no earlier than 10 and quit no later than 6
Long lunch break if people have to find it outside and do it during rush-lunch
Coffee worth drinking
An observational outing to a fascinating nearby place

Mostly ppl with several years of experience who are also engaging speakersInstead of trying to create a general ideal conference for the masses, consider having a more focused theme with a message / goal for the target audience.
