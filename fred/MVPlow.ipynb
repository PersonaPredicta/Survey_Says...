I’m not sure how’d you’d do that at a conference, but, in general, it’s nice to have space for people who are trying to advance research at their organization. A lot of events seem geared toward getting research off the ground or breaking into the business, which I also love, but sometimes it’s nice to have a conversation that goes beyond the basics. \n",

      "For the love of god, do not ask non-researchers to present actual research. It's so terribly disheartening to see poor-quality research presented from a stage. Have professionals do it. If you get researchers who know what they're doing, they may need coaching for how to present dramatically and with interest. I'd rather see someone who has contributed to the knowledge of the world who needs a little help with jazz hands than some 28-year-old who doesn't know what a p-value is pretend they've just invented \"technology studies.\"\n",

The world will benefit greatly from having more skilled researchers in it, but the current paths we have for gaining experience are fairly limited.  We need to grow more senior researchers and research strategists. We need to grow business acumen and help people gain strategies for dealing with organizations that don't embrace research (or apply the results).  \n",

I like the idea of a small, intimate conference that focuses on interactive sessions and workshops rather than papers (there is a place for that too, but I feel there are enough of those). I'd love a space where I can take my own challenges on my team and in terms of my experience and work on those so I have a game plan when I get back to my office--i.e. maybe some coaching in how to define challenges and possible approaches, with some solid materials on tech trends in digital products. \n",

I read an article years back about a leading designer who was being asked about how he kept engaged with his craft. He said he studies \"other\" things. He'd take ballroom dancing, or read about physics, or any non-subject related topics. Inevitably he'd find inspiration in those topics while reflecting on design tasks.  We're creatures of analogy.

I would love the opportunity to build more solid relationships with the interesting people I have encountered in places like Twitter and Slack. Have it in NYC, that is your stomping ground! Try it as a 1 day event and see how it goes. If it's awesome, make it longer + workshops. I'd love a day in NYC to hear a bunch of talks.
