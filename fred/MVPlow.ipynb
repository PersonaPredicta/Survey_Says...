Part of the conversation also needs to be on tactically how to evaluate your organization's UX Maturity level, and strategically how to move  your organization up the UX Maturity level chain. Additionally, what do you need to do this (sponsorship, organizational structure, etc.)? When do you call it quits and head off to a different company?  \n",

I do think your name is strong enough to get you up the profitability curve more quickly than normal. // Also, and this may be controversial, I'd love to see a conference that weeds out complete newbies and consists only of attendees who are serious practitioners. No idea how to make that work, though.\n",

I'd love to hear from people who know the pitfalls and doubts about it, and how they get through that.   Maybe even a few analogous scientific researchers who are looking at, say, worms and wondering, \"Am I testing the right thing?\" and how they approach that research to deal with doubt.\n",

So hypothetically, if you were to organise a conference on research, my advice would be to start by gaining credibility in the field. As someone who's never heard the name before, I don't know who you are, why you care and this survey doesn't seem to indicate you're an expert in the field, unfortunately - despite thanking people for proof-reading / pilot testing this survey... \n",

While I do like to hear talks from leaders in the research industry, I also want to be inspired by others who are not—people who have great stories of human connection that have nothing to do with \"research\", while still being inspiring to researchers.
