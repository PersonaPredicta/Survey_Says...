      "Front Utah did a great job with the welcoming committee and allowing for longer breaks between sessions (4 30-minute talks, and then a 30 minute break). They also did a great job of getting folks out into the surrounding city where they host (every swag bag had a $20 bill and a map of local restaurants w/in walking distance -- attendees were encouraged to group up and go find lunch).\n",
