So hypothetically, if you were to organise a conference on research, my advice would be to start by gaining credibility in the field. As someone who's never heard the name before, I don't know who you are, why you care and this survey doesn't seem to indicate you're an expert in the field, unfortunately - despite thanking people for proof-reading / pilot testing this survey... \n",

      "Even though I have been conducting research for 3 years, I still have a lot of doubts about whether I did the right thing or got the right information to the team. I think it would be awesome if the said hypothetical conference can in some way provide guidance to young researchers to let us know that we are doing alright, or course correct if necessary. So I guess some sort of mentorship? But that's solutioning already...\n",

      "Document 2\n",
      "The deeper you go into the subject matter the better. A lot of research literature is either design adjacent or academic. Focusing on a research practitioners day-to-day, someone that is in a software company or an agency or a startup, would be super helpful. Anything that helps me grow my skills and competencies to ultimately be a better researcher.\n",

      "Document 3\n",
      "Think outside the typical conference box. Allow for more discussion and deep dives on actual research studies. As a participant I want to engage and create take-aways and artifacts that I can share with colleagues when I get back to work. I don't mind getting homework to complete. I want to network through structured activities. I want to stay connected to fellow participants over time and continue discussions until the next \"conference\". \n",

      "Document 4\n",
      "I've noticed there's a trend for Social Psychologists in an academic field, UX Designers wanting more of an impact into the research process, and even Product Managers being tasked with research (within a product context). Something that would attract all of audiences, not just those already with a UX Design background.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would actually appreciate vendors that gave demos of the tools. As a practitioner sometimes our view is either limited, or if we engage with a sales person we never hear the end of it. It's almost a low pressure way to get access to the same content.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recently attended a conference where there were no organized after conference activities and it was the worst. I was quite disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would prefer a shorter conference (2-3 days rather than a full week), and the option to mix and match sessions. Sometimes the full track suffers from weaker content and I can see my $ being wasted away. \n",

      "Document 5\n",
      "I'd like a lot of discussion around the business of research; I'd hope that it would be set up in a non-intimidating format where people could genuinely learn from each other and be able to have meaningful conversation that helps researchers to advance their own practices. If we had all of those brilliant heads in the room I mentioned above, I think a panel talking about the future of research would be fascinating as well. It would also be interesting to have a talk somewhere about remote research or the intersection of research roles and the remote workforce (that is just especially relevant to me). I would also hope that there was a nice blend of qual/quant, or maybe separate tracks for each that people could interweave between. If there is a design research focus, in particular, I think a nice balance of generative and evaluative would be important as well. And last but not least, it could be cool to explore via a workshop or something the areas of the world that we see ripe with opportunity for research to have an impact (outside of the traditional software product team scope).\n",

      "Go for it. I read most a lot of your books and the level is never upsetting. Don’t fall in the trap of sponsoring talks which are mere adds in a talk form and give the micro and freedom to top researchers presenting high-quality content instead. I’d love to attend.\n",

      "Please consider virtual attendance for those who cannot make it in person! Maybe there could be a lesser fee to pay for virtual attendees and we can join in on certain talks or at least get immediate audio recordings? I know it would require informed consent of speaker(s) involved and there may be technical feasibility issues, but often conferences are pushed to the wayside because of other priorities. \n",

      "I'd like to see both qual and quant represented. I'd love to see one big intersection of research, industries and backgrounds. I'd be interested in a conference that went beyond talks or workshops per se. I'd be interested in creative ways to involve all attendees in idea exchange. Then, somehow synthesize data/themes from those \"micro\" exchanges and report on those. Not sure what that would entail, but something like that would interest me.  \n",

      "The two conferences I have attended in the past year have been on the smaller side (250-500 attendees), have been 1 or 2 days, and had built-in networking times with a social hour after. Both of these conferences (UX Burlington and Talk UX) were nicely intimate, and you could eat lunch with the speakers if you were lucky to sit at the same table as them. Lot's of food options for folks with food sensitivities and allergies is always appreciated! Most conferences default to the sandwich/wrap/salad option, but I always say conferences should consider a burrito bar. \n",

      "I'd also consider bringing in some random topics. Opera. Bookbinding. NASA water systems. I read an article years back about a leading designer who was being asked about how he kept engaged with his craft. He said he studies \"other\" things. He'd take ballroom dancing, or read about physics, or any non-subject related topics. Inevitably he'd find inspiration in those topics while reflecting on design tasks.  We're creatures of analogy. Setting up learning experiences where we can let individuals connect the dots between seemingly unrelated topics can be exhilarating!  \n",
