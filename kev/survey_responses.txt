Living in Australia, conferences are very far away and ideally you combine it with other travel to keep costs down and to have to go through jetlag only twice.

No seriously, think about who your target group is, and how to advertise. If it was too generic, I would not feel it's urgent/interesting enough to give up another conference for it (because that's probably what it would boil down to).

Maybe co-locate with existing large conferences? In my area that would be CHI (Computer-Human Interaction), you could add a day on. That would increase my chances of going, because I would not get funding to travel to a conference if I can't present a paper there, and if it isn't high impact.

You could consider going digital? But I've never attended such an event, don't know whether it would be as compelling."	"Yes, I was taught how to conduct research"

I ended up taking 1 year of methods applied specifically our dissertation research. It wasn't until I got my first job while still in grad school for the National Institutes of Health that I learned how to do methods properly with a team of anthropologists, sociologists, clinicians, etc. that I really started to hone my skills and learn how to articulate my methods to people beyond my field. "	"I always tag on a little family vacation onto conferences/events, so a nice conference location that is easily accessible is a big plus for our family. We live close to a major airport (LAX), so it is very easy to get direct flights. We have an 1yr old who goes to all my conferences along with my partner who provides childcare, so travel arrangements and affordable accommodations close to the event space is important so I can go back and breastfeed.

For local events, the later in the evening the better b/c so much traffic here in LA. Also, events tend to be on the Westside and DTLA which are both really expensive places to live and most people commute to--it's important that events not always be held in the same place every time so more accessible to people. Same with big conferences--I wouldn't mind a nice conference in a rural area that is beautiful and in nature.

Note: I wasn't sure what ""code of conduct in place"" meant above, so I just put down ""not important at all"" b/c no ""n/a"" or ""I don't know"" option."	"I went to a conference in Cleveland--boring town, but great tiny conference on science and technology--there was nothing to so everyone stayed at the conference and hanged. There weren't 100 panels going every 15 min, but rather a couple of panels with very good attendance and you would run into people and really get to know each other and have a common thing to talk. Discussion was easy to do with strangers b/c everyone attended the same panels since not so many to go to. The smaller, the more intimate, the better."

I would love to see some unlikely orgs at a research/design conference--like Dept of Public Health, the VA. These people do research everyday with lots of red tape and constraints, and industry folk could learn a lot from them. 

Academics too--there needs to be more exchange across academia and industry b/c this is their bread n butter for academics."	"I don't know anything about Rosenfeld Media, but---

I would say look into hybrids--pull in academics + industry + public sector...pull in people who aren't just doing flashy ""innovation"" and ""revolutionary"" stuff, pull in people on the ground doing research and who are experts at this. I've been to a lot of talks where they pull someone in to talk about research at a well known company (e.g., Airbnb or Uber or etc...) to draw a crowd, and while they have beautiful slides, the content is often subpar or all NDA-ed up that they can't really talk about anything. Get researchers out there in the field talking to people and making mistakes that they can share and others can learn from.

Lately I've been really digging applied conferences, such as the WWF Fuller Symposium about using behavior change for conservation and sustainability practices."	WWF Fuller comes to mind in part because it was fairly recent. What I loved was that it alternated What and Why between the speakers. One speaker would share an amazing case study of their applied work. The next would talk more about theory and approach. This alternation made it easy to grasp how the case studies were done and how the theory could look in practice.	I don't know that I've attended any specifically about research.

I'd also consider bringing in some random topics. Opera. Bookbinding. NASA water systems. I read an article years back about a leading designer who was being asked about how he kept engaged with his craft. He said he studies ""other"" things. He'd take ballroom dancing, or read about physics, or any non-subject related topics. Inevitably he'd find inspiration in those topics while reflecting on design tasks.  We're creatures of analogy. Setting up learning experiences where we can let individuals connect the dots between seemingly unrelated topics can be exhilarating!

A mix of workshops, hands-on learning, lightning talks by new speakers with new perspectives to share, off-site activities / site visits, ""networking by doing stuff""... that would be my sweet spot. Throw in a keynote or two maybe. 
I feel I am not alone in this view, especially when i talk to more senior practitioners. They are often not in the talk but outside, chatting. 

Other advice: I'm biased and maybe trying to sell my own agenda a bit here, but feel that there is a growing distaste for long-haul air travel. You're seeing that in Europe in the ""never fly"" movement. 
If you did multiple regional events (a bit like how An Event Apart does it), instead of a big International 1-time event, that could help environmentally-conscious folk make the decision more easily. 
Also, having a posted zero-waste approach (no vendor tchotckes!), carbon offset policy, etc can help ppl alleviate the guilt.  

Remote events: I know Rosenfeld has done all-remote events in the past (I don't know how they went, I haven't seen any new ones posted). I'm curious about the potential of remote workshop events over just remote ""webinar"" talky events. I've been to a couple of remote design/participation events (facilitated by Jim Kalbach's MURAL), and I think they are on to something. "	"No, I was not taught how to conduct research"

* I like how at CHI you can also get grouped with people to lunch with and you virtually meet them in advance (less intimidating for introverts).
* It could be interesting to do ""working studio sessions."" Like you could bring a project that you've been meaning to work on but never get to, and then buddy up with a small group of people who are working on something similar. Then your goal would be by the end of the session to make some progress during that time and share/get feedback on it.

It includes a few research modules and research was a part of each project	I'm often invited to speak or attend conferences for free so will chose to spend my time at those rather then seek out one to go to because of budget. I am keen on hearing from key players in the industry so will look at the line up. I also try not to see the same speakers too soon because it will often be the same talk. Travel is fine if I'm going with friends or. The conference is really worth it. I also look to rwcommeneations and what other people say about the conference. Networking might play a part.

Host a working conference in North America. I experienced one in Wu Xi, China. And came away feeling affected, helped and re-engaged. All of this ""talking about research"" may just be tired. Or it might be the wrong way to make a lasting difference? Dunno. Couldn't a small team of people create a body of evidence, and a small set of topics, and lead/facilitate/teach sessions with real data? 

I/we desperately need a conference that helps restore some love of critical thinking, explanatory depth, and disciplined understandings of frameworks and tools. The larger community is acting in a way that could soon be automated. i.e. I see people filling journey frameworks and personae templates with junk, that reinforces a confirmation bias in the self and in the larger gathering. The slides most photographed are 'The 5 ways to nana about nanana... '  That feels like a darkness in our community. This from a community that pledges a form of enlightenment."

"	"This question is written from a perspective that doesn't fit well, with my situation. For instance I had stopped attending conferences, or speaking at them for 5 years. Research conferences have to my mind become homogenized. Same cast of speakers. Same subject matter. No affordances for engaging with a stranger (my version of networking). No ways for this old dog to learn a new trick. No awareness  in the UX/agile/digital is everything hype and myopia that takes hold of our HCD community.  And well no talk of this ethical moment we all experience. No talk of our our responsiblity in the face of dark patterns...  I think you get the theme. "	"Recently I joined the REACH network for a global get together on the subject of consideration transformations. Calling it ""great"" might be an exaggeration. But it felt worthy. Useful. Encouraging. And, inspiring, in a call to act sort of way.

There is not enough effort at decoding the mundane acts and phenomenon of life. A move in this direction would tamp down some of the hype that infects most conferences. Also, ethical conundrums, and ethical acts within power dynamics. HCD is signing its name to some very dark patterns. And celebrating those act on stage at design and research conferences around the world. Finally, let's talk about Porter's concept of creating shared value. Perhaps with the benefit of the UN SDG framework. Oh yeah, why not make some arrangements to take participants out into the field!  Imagine that. "	"Anyone but the usual suspects, please.  A kitten dies every time the roster begins with Jared Spool. Just saying. In a conversation about the celebrity of Jan Chipchase someone pointed out doesn't the celebrity thing undermine the ability to perform research? Maybe not, but I think you feel the point. Please emphasize what we are getting up to, working on, or engaging in. And leave the cult of celebrity for other events. "	I feel like I have baked that in to prior comments.

I would probably want to get involved with a conference that took on some of the massive delusions in the industry today such as over-reliance on tech, the digital delusion, a clear-eyed discussion of the state of online research, the ""big data"" crock, etc. The second largest gorilla in the room is the complete lack of training in our industry. How many people just decided one day to be an ethnographer? Where's the training for how to become more empathetic? How many have really taken a course on storytelling? 

But the biggest gorilla is the industry's refusal to come to grips with ""insight."" To define it, understand how only humans have insights. That you can't ""gather insight."" How people can become more insightful. To admit that 99.9% of what the ""insight"" industry sells its clients is just more data, sometimes useful knowledge. To admit that developing real insights is incredibly hard work that takes a long time and lots of money! And to realize that since we have commodified data collection the only place to go is to true insights.

Anyway. I've blogged about a lot of this stuff here www.theinsightsguy.com

I see a huge number of early-career folks who are struggling to get work in UX research roles, and we need to get them real-world experience (not just the General Assembly courses or an academic degree).  The world will benefit greatly from having more skilled researchers in it, but the current paths we have for gaining experience are fairly limited.

We need to grow business acumen and help people gain strategies for dealing with organizations that don't embrace research (or apply the results).

If it's a trusted source that goes a long way and I'd argue those sources have the opportunity to add fresh new speakers by at least 25-50% of their speakers). Travel is a HUGE consideration. My company has a very limited budget as do I (student loans anyone?) so the cost is a big factor in determining whether or not I'll go. Not to mention finding the business argument for going (you could add to this by finding a nonUX reason for going. Why? Because there's still a lot of work to be done convincing business that what we do matters and that it's important to keep us educated).

I feel like we're at a moment in time with research where everybody wants to start a research practice in larger companies but they're just aren't enough seasoned researchers out there to sort of lead these things.

And lately, I feel like the people who it would excite me the most to see at a conference like this are the people who use/order/budget research -- as that would be a sign that they are interested in really understanding the importance of research and why its something that an organization should invest in."

Given your author base, I can easily see Rosenfeld putting together an amazing lineup for a conference.  Your far greater challenge -- as you know, hence this survey -- is carving out your niche. I wish I had better advice about that.

I feel that the ""techniques"" side is covered across a range of conferences. I feel like there are less conferences that really focus on the strategic (and possibly ops) side of research. Likewise there might be opportunities around more directly exploring the alchemic process of turning research into action."	"No, I was not taught how to conduct research"

In my recent roles there has no longer been an emphasis on this but rather on strategic research to identify opportunities.  It feels like market research and UX research are blending to some degree.  As someone with 15 years of experience I have started to see usability of products decrease as organizations more and more emphasize strategic research (evaluative methods seem to be just taken for granted or ignored completely).  I'd love to learn if some organizations are keeping a good balance and not ignoring one critical aspect of what we do.  I'd also love to talk about this more with others in terms of the future of UX Research in organizations.	"I'd love to see some of the originals.

It would also be interesting to have a talk somewhere about remote research or the intersection of research roles and the remote workforce (that is just especially relevant to me). I would also hope that there was a nice blend of qual/quant, or maybe separate tracks for each that people could interweave between. If there is a design research focus, in particular, I think a nice balance of generative and evaluative would be important as well.

"Consider that the audience may be in different maturity levels of the research practice at least for some sessions so you may have different tracks based on that to cover a wider range of people.

At a certain level of maturity, co-working sessions can be more enlighting than workshops so it may be interesting to build some knowledge from the conference. Especially because product design research is a discipline that we are currently nailing and adapting to our needs and there are lots of topics that we should build together as a community. It is tricky in logistic terms but very catchy as well.

I appreciated the focus on research and found the experience level of both speakers and attendees made it worthwhile. I did not attend this year's conference, but had several people mention to me that they found it a great place to commiserate, but they did not come away from the conference with a lot of clear solutions or takeaways. I have discussed this a bit with Steve, but I find the challenge with anything research-based is that there just aren't very many clear best practices or one-size-fits-all solutions to things. One of the reasons I appreciate a conference with a lot of experienced people is that I can listen to variety of experiences and case studies and hear how others have tackled problems they face and synthesize various parts of those into my own unique solutions and problems. Every org and every research project is its own situation. No two are alike. Every org has different culture and politics and capabilities. It's up to us as researchers to devise the solution that fits best. So one thing I would keep in mind is that anyone coming to a research conference hoping to walk away with all the answers they need in some cut and dried state is likely to leave disappointed. This may sound really obvious, but it's something I've only personally realized rather recently.

I like the idea of a small, intimate conference that focuses on interactive sessions and workshops rather than papers (there is a place for that too, but I feel there are enough of those). I'd love a space where I can take my own challenges on my team and in terms of my experience and work on those so I have a game plan when I get back to my office--i.e. maybe some coaching in how to define challenges and possible approaches, with some solid materials on tech trends in digital products. 

I also see a space for retraining academics for this field--I get asked about this a lot and have written about it on my website (http://www.rachelfleming.net/faqs) and will be writing more, as this is a critical need right now. I want to get involved more in helping academics find new employment options. 

I'm not sure where you're based but having the conference be within the US would probably help with getting my company to pay for it. Advertising well in advance is also helpful because I have to decide about the conference I'm attending several months before. As for venue, I prefer retreat settings to a hotel or conference center, to set the tone of it being a transformational experience. "	"No, I was not taught how to conduct research"

"	"I've noticed there's a trend for Social Psychologists in an academic field, UX Designers wanting more of an impact into the research process, and even Product Managers being tasked with research (within a product context). Something that would attract all of audiences, not just those already with a UX Design background.

I would actually appreciate vendors that gave demos of the tools. As a practitioner sometimes our view is either limited, or if we engage with a sales person we never hear the end of it. It's almost a low pressure way to get access to the same content.

I recently attended a conference where there were no organized after conference activities and it was the worst. I was quite disappointed.

I would prefer a shorter conference (2-3 days rather than a full week), and the option to mix and match sessions. Sometimes the full track suffers from weaker content and I can see my $ being wasted away.

"Location is the primary factor to consider because it will indicate whether I can afford to attend or not. My company will cover cost of entry to a conference or workshop, but will not cover travel or accommodation. I also use personal vacation time to attend learning sessions, so if I spend more of that time in transit, I have to take that into consideration. Secondly, the topic of conversation and the format of learning is key. I often get frustrated with 60 mins lectures that barely scratch the surface of a question of challenge so I will be much more likely to attend if there are hands-on workshops, which also give me the chance to better network. If the topic matter closely aligns with my interests, that may cinch the decision, but honestly, the conference reputation and speakers are probably bigger factors."

"I really like how An Event Apart and Front Utah are structured. They're single-track, limited audiences with highly curated speakers. And each instance has a very specific topic/focus (the last Front was PM+UX, which is super-relevant to me right now). It makes my decision process easier, and also guarantees I'll be exposed to different perspectives or challenging talks."	"None specific to research, tbh.

Theoretical and high level is good for C-levels, for persuasion, for rallying the troops, but I am the troops and I'd love really tactical information at this point."	"Don't be afraid to mimic conferences that are doing things right.
For instance, An Event Apart limits their attendees to a manageable size and highly curates their speakers.
Front Utah did a great job with the welcoming committee and allowing for longer breaks between sessions (4 30-minute talks, and then a 30 minute break). They also did a great job of getting folks out into the surrounding city where they host (every swag bag had a $20 bill and a map of local restaurants w/in walking distance -- attendees were encouraged to group up and go find lunch).
Lots of conferences use Slack for pre-conference introductions, a channel for each speaker, they handle Q&A through the Slack channels (which allows attendees to ""vote"" for their questions if they've already been asked)... it's an interesting use of a communication platform like that."

"I can't think of the ""best"" because I have had many excellent experiences. However, an aspect the best have had in common were that the instructors were academics who were not getting paid for running the course and had no motivation other than we learn how to do the technique that had been rigorously tested: Herb Simon teaching think-aloud protocol elicitation, Clayton Lewis teaching Cognitive Walkthrough, Peter Polson and Dave Kieras teaching GOMS, Dennis Wixon teaching Contextual Inquiry (when he was at DEC, working with Karen Holtzblatt). All of these (except the first) were at CHI conference courses and all were quite a while ago. Sadly CHI has changed their course structure and fewer academics teach practical courses now (though some still do, see below). I find the consultants who teach are often trying to make their students into clients, so they don't teach in as much detail, or with as much honesty about when the technique is NOT appropriate, as I need to do the technique myself."

Our team is really fond of quantitative methods and metrics so these surveys also serve a really important purpose in setting the stage of what product area to dive into further with specific studies. From there we use generative research methods such as interviews and contextual inquiry to understand a problem space, before analyzing that information for insights and creating some sort of prototype. At that point we use usability testing as a way to gauge whether or not a solution to the problem is effective."	Our team is very interested in any research that's feasible in a given timeframe. Our biggest interest is investing in a tool that would allow us to do unmoderated usability testing.		"I like to attend events by organizations that I recognize and respect.

"Cooper U: UX Bootcamp was the greatest learning experience ever. It was 4 days long and was an intensive workshop with outstanding teachers. It was held at Alan Cooper's ranch in Northern CA, so the setting was beautiful and inspiring and away from the noise and distraction of the city. There were only 30 or so participants to a staff of 4 teachers and Alan and Sue stopped by throughout to hang out and answer questions. Everything was focused to teaching Goal-Directed Design and I had little free time which was fine because I was there to learn. 

Some of the most important factors were:
Ample time - 4 days - to learn the material and practice
Quality teachers - not just outstanding in their field, but quality teachers
Environment - Everything was designed around learning

During undergraduate studies I also worked at a research lab where I helped to conduct and analyze social science research.	"Locations that are convenient to me (near my office), interesting topics that seem like I will learn something new. Personally, I don't really feel like events are that great for learning as the presentation is usually so vague and general that it's not that useful, there is more value in the networking aspect."

"The two conferences I have attended in the past year have been on the smaller side (250-500 attendees), have been 1 or 2 days, and had built-in networking times with a social hour after. Both of these conferences (UX Burlington and Talk UX) were nicely intimate, and you could eat lunch with the speakers if you were lucky to sit at the same table as them. Lot's of food options for folks with food sensitivities and allergies is always appreciated!

I'm very fortunate that my company is very supportive of encouraging employees to attend conferences and events, so travel is not too much of an obstacle as long as I can explain why an event would be of particular benefit to me."	"I think that I'd say EPIC, due to its diversity both in terms of content and the variety of formats throughout the conference. In addition to presentations, panel discussions and case studies, the schedule also included salons (small groups assembled to participate in guided discussions), pechakuchas, a short film session and an exhibition space. This gave plenty of opportunities to dive deep into certain topics while also 'take a break' and feel refreshed by lighter sessions, like the pechakuchas. The social events were also top-notch, which is certainly a plus.

I think SIGCHI does a pretty good job at this. 

I feel like there is a divide between user researchers working in industry and HCI and UCD people in academia. From the conversations I've been having with practitioners in both fields there is a tendency to 'look down' on each other. I find people who work in academic settings find people working in industry taking a bit of a 'fast and loose' approach to research. On the other hand, I find people working in industry see people working in academic backgrounds to work in an overly philosophical/ivory tower/slow way in terms of their research approch

I think there is a real opportunity to bridge the gap between the two.  There's a ton the two could learn from each other. "	Government healthcare	all aspect of qual and quant	more remote research (shoutout to Nate Bolt) ;)	HCI	"I prefer research conferences with more scientific rigor (e.g. SIGCHI conferences) than what is currently out there. I'm finding a lot of UX and UR conferences are becoming almost like live versions of Medium posts or used for an opportunity to sell something or regurgitating things that have been covered to death (e.g. ""UX isn't just UI!"")

I find communities and conferences under the SIGCHI umbrella have more structure, legitimacy, and rigor in terms of professionalism and quality of papers/speakers/topics covered.

The caliber and information and activities given in these sessions were very hands on and it was kind of a shift and change in the way we wanted to work. It was inspiring and I felt very motivated to work with my colleagues and tackle real problems within our product.
Also the thing that made it VERY useful is that our C level management had bought into the idea of working in a hole way that leverages research and learning early on in the product development cycle."

We do the full gamut- discovery research, concept testing, usability testing, surveys, look at customer service logs, etc."	"A lot of our goals are focused on collaboration. It’s not just about conducting research, but finding ways to bring  data scientists and engineers and designers into the fold more often so they live and breathe it. "	"I worked in an HCI lab in my undergrad career for two years, and also got my masters in HCI. "	"Is it directly relevant to my day to day work? Do I need it to become a more successful or efficient employee? Do I need an essential skill to get to the next level/career ladder? If the answer is yes, I strongly am interested in attending an event. "	"I went to a talk hosted by AIGA on the design process around creating Alexandria Ocasió-Cortez’s campaign branding and identity. The topic was socially and professionally relevant, the speaker was prepared and engaging, and the quality of the content he shared was incredible. There was an anonymous Q&A that followed where the moderator used an app called Pigeonhole to curate questions from the crowd, and deliver it to the speaker to answer. There was also refreshments and networking afterward. It was well worth the $35 I spent on the talk! "	"I’ve attended a ton of meetups, a workshop on remote research, a workshop on Kano modeling, and a workshop on mentorship/career management. "	Small conference: < 300 attendees	2	Single-track: All attendees experience the same content at the same time	"I would love if if veteran members of the community share more of their war stories with those who are just starting out or mid-career. I think the whole community could benefit from lessons learned.

Also, I would love to learn more about the softer sides that make research successful and influential, such as conflict management, stakeholder management (often the same thing!), effective communication, and career management. There has to be knowledge transfer in the community in terms of soft skills like these as well if we want to maximize the impact of research. "	"Specific individuals who have very interesting war stories to share, or have had great track record forecasting industry trends and would like to the share with the community. "	"Then this is an interestingly “hypothetical” survey! 

I would try to tailor content not only based on quality/quant, but based on the experience level of those who are attending. People starting out in research think and need different skill sets than those running large teams and years into their practice!

Also, please PLEASE emphasize depth over breadth. Researchers want to learn deeply about something specific and actionable, not just hand-wavy things that we can’t directly take and apply in their everyday context. I would prefer long, well-thought out and curated presentations that I can take and run with in my organization over soundbite-driven panels any day!

Will talks be more theoretical or have methods for practical application? Practical application is important to me, so I'd rather hear people who have industry experience share their journeys. I prefer local events as I don't have a large professional development budget at work, so can't afford to travel for events/conferences."	"I loved going to the Design/Content conference last year in Vancouver.

For example, I would love to hear how someone leads a global research team, but that advice isn't immediately relevant to me since I'm far from being a supervisor.  Instead, I'd be interested to hear from someone who has been in research for 1-2 years, and built a research practice from the ground up.

"	"I'm independent and therefore I need to balance ticket and travel costs with perceived career benefit I'm more likely to attend if I can get free admittance by volunteering or scholarship because I find that conferences are rarely worth attending. Networking opportunities are a priority as I find conferences tend to talk about the same topics with the same speakers. However, I like to look for structured networking opportunities (e.g., small groups, speednetworking, one-on-one scheduled meetings) rather than just lunch or happy hours because it forces senior attendees to interact with people other than those in their friend or professional networks. I also prefer workshops over talks because I find the takeaways are more relevant and practical"	"Business of Software was very small and intimate (many opportunities to network). It also had a culture of welcoming new attendees. For example, new attendees had a special color badge which encouraged regulars to approach and strike up a conversation. The talks were also informal (many disaster stories with interesting lessons--not just sales pitches) and short with lots of time for questions."	UXPA Boston	Small conference: < 300 attendees	2	Single-track: All attendees experience the same content at the same time	"1) Research with disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, 2) How to start and formalize a research process in your company or organization, 3) Research ethics, 4) Research in government, or social and humanitarian sector, 5) Issues of power and inequality between researchers, users, and their organizations, 6) Innovative quantitative methods
"	"People who work in the social, humanitarian, or gov't sectors. "	"-Diversity in speaking experience and seniority level*** (I love when conferences open up spots specifically for unknowns or new speakers who are doing really cool work)
-Diversity in race (just Asians does not count as diversity)
-Diversity in organization type (Not just IDEO, Stanford and Big Four researchers. Invite independent consultants, startup people, ""boring"" traditional companies you don't usually associate with innovation, nonprofit people, gov't people)

-Informality. I'd prefer a quick talk followed by extended Q&A/workshop over 45 minute talk

-Prioritize social topics (e.g., researching for gov't or humanitarian work), new topics (e.g., new tech requires new research strategies), under-discussed topics (e.g., ethics, workplace culture), war stories (case studies of failure) vs. big name speakers. I also find motivational talks are rarely that impressive. If I'm going to sit through a talk I want to learn actionable takeaways that I can immediately apply to my own work. Inspiration is great and a good speaker will inspire but I do want to learn something.

-Not too many talks in one day. Create breathers for reflection and networking.

-Structured networking (small table discussion, pre-conference Slack channel, speednetworking)

-Dry social events (yes, there are non-drinkers in tech) and options other than water for non-drinkers during meals"	"Yes, I was taught how to conduct research"

Courses included experimental study design, human factors and academic research from 2006 to 2009. I also took a sociology class in 2006 that taught more ethnographic research methods. All of the above courses came with courses about how to conduct research (clinical interview, observation, experimentation, questionnaire design, statistics etc.) as well as practical research projects within those courses and in other curses (e.g. interview applied to clinical psychology course, observation of children in developmental psychology course, ethnographic observation/interviews in human factors course... experimentation and questionnaires in cognitive psychology course etc.). One of these led to the publication of a scientific article.  Then I completed a masters degree in research applied to game development, where i learnt and practiced new methods: eye tracking, focus groups, playtesting, usability testing, prototyping for usability tests etc. more stats, and courses in how to work with and communicate results to stakeholders effectively, validated by an academic research project. To complete the degree I had to put all these skills to practice during a 6 month internship. While working, I later took courses in statistics, data analysis, tableau software, A/B testing as part of professional training within the company where i worked, live from colleagues and online from moocs."	"For meetups, i will attend if the topic is interesting, it's accessible in less than 30 minutes commute, it happens outside of work hours. Sometimes i'll go to accompany a friend. I will not go if i had a negative experience at a previous iteration of the event.
For conferences, I'll go if there's enough talks that interest me, if i can attend as a speaker, if it's convenient to get there and find a hotel nearby, if I manage to get time off to go. I'll also consider if there's friends i rarely see that also attend to catch up with them and if I can combine the trip with other activities e.g. taking a longer vacation to visit family in the same time period/rough location as the event. If I decide to go, I will do so regardless of the cost and possibly indulge in a better hotel/closer to the event even if it means it is more expensive.  I will NOT go if it takes place anywhere in the USA or if it requires taking a plane trip to attend it.  "	"Learning about tableau software was my best professional learning experience because it was a friend who's a subject matter expert who taught me and a couple of other researcher friends. He was teaching us because we wanted to learn it and he needed to test his course before giving it to a whole class of students for the first time. The tiny audience, close knit group and ability to ask in depth questions with concrete examples using actual confidential data to complete concrete exercices was the best part. It was a 6 week, 3h/week course with take home assignments in between, mostly done face to face with a few sessions over skype."	"GUR SIG Conference in London, twice.

Workshops where we'd do some research together - getting to collaborate with peers on actual research for example for a non profit organisation or a good cause (e.g. helping the environment) as a means of getting to know peers/networking etc. "	"personal friends, a variety of people - not just researchers but anyone interested in research or who works with researchers and wants to learn/benefit more from what research can do for them. also peers, hiring managers, students, designers, producers, product owners etc. anyone who should be involved in research planning"	"My goal is to provide constructive criticism, so apologies in advance for being blunt. I hope you can use it to succeed in your hypothetical plans. I've been bugged from end to end with the anchors you chose to use in your survey.
I have no idea how you're going to understand the data you've collected, especially since I have no idea how i was supposed understand the question. What does neutral do in the middle? Why is something at best somewhat important, but can't be slightly important? I may be picky and perfectionist, but it bothers me a lot. So hypothetically, if you were to organise a conference on research, my advice would be to start by gaining credibility in the field. As someone who's never heard the name before, I don't know who you are, why you care and this survey doesn't seem to indicate you're an expert in the field, unfortunately - despite thanking people for proof-reading / pilot testing this survey...
