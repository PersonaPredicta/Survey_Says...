So mostly smaller conferences and workshops are best when I'm trying to deepens my knowledge on a specific methodology), (4.0, 500-750), (4.0, Large conference: 500+ attendees), (6.0, All of these are fine.

Not intro content.), (6.0, I don't consider this an important factor), (6.0, I don't mind at all), (6.0, I don't really think size is a decisive factor... I can imagine amazing event in small and also in large scale), (6.0, I honestly don't care about size comparative to contenr), (6.0, I really don’t have a preference), (6.0, I will consider any size of conference), (6.0, I would attend any of these), (6.0, I'm not sure that number of attendees would be an influencing factor - other factors are more important to me), (6.0, I'm open to anything. I like the small retreats and small conferences for their intimacy but sometimes I want the options of a large conference.), (6.0, It doesn’t matter, content is the king ), (6.0, It is not important the size), (6.0, No preference), (6.0, Not a variable that would affect my decision), (6.0, Number of people isn't my only consideration it's mainly location and cost. I would be happy with all of the above.), (6.0, Size doesn’t matter to me), (6.0, Size isn't important), (6.0, This does not factor in to my decision.), (6.0, it doesn't matter), (6.0, no ideal size, but <100 could be interesting), (6.0, no preference on size), (7.0, Depends on what I want to learn and how intensely), (7.0, Honestly a mis of retreat-mid size), (7.0, I chose Other, when I really wanted to choose retreat but NOT workshop, I think those are very different. My experience with workshops is being led through a bunch of predetermined exercises whereas at a retreat I'd imagine having space to explore ), (7.0, I like large conferences for inspiration. Like the idea of a retreat for specialist learning. Assume it's too expensive), (7.0, It depends - I really enjoyed small conferences as IXDA Education Summit as there is great opportunity to network with other educators. On the other side, sometimes is great just to attend big conference to find an inspiration or just to meet coll...), (7.0, It depends on how it's planned), (7.0, It really depends. if there are VIPs having talks. I don't expect that conference to be small.. and when it's small, I don't expect VIPs to talk...), (7.0, It's hard to pick an ideal size! I'd say 500+ would start to get pretty impersonal, but it really depends what networking opportunities the organisers provide. I've never been to a retreat-style event, but intrigued by this!), (7.0, No opinion - it all depends on the quality of the topics and speakers), (7.0, Size depends on intent. If learning new skill and majority of learning is from official conf content, small is great. But most times I learn far more from diverse people met rather than official content.), (7.0, Size matters for learning topics, but not networking and inspiration.), (7.0, Small or Large for different reasons), (7.0, Sorry, it really depends on the context. Hard to pick one. ), (7.0, The right balance between cost and number of attendees), (7.0, There is no idea, it depends on who the other attendees are and how the size affects other things like location/cost etc.), (7.0, depending on the professional values), (7.0, open to any of the above; depends on the format/contennt etc), (8.0, I prefer virtual. Too many in our community are driven by destructive motives.), (8.0, Remote, no limit for the number of attendees ), (8.0, Using teleconference tech, so 1 person)]\n",
